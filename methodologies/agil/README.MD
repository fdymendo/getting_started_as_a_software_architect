It is important to read [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/iso/es/manifesto.html)

#  About

* Agile likes constant change
* Different teams working in an involved way
* Fail fast to learn and adjust fast.
* Each delivery must be uploaded to production
* At any point in agile development, development can be stopped, which is why the backlog exists and is organized by importance.
* The separation or grouping of tasks must be at the business level and not technical

# Important points

* You should always prioritize what generates value for the business
* The user stories must have a maximum of 3 days, this includes design development and tests.
* The schedule is created based on the most critical activities. Not based on features
* You should always have a test environment equal to production before starting development
* Agile methodologies never said to eliminate documentation, you must have the necessary documentation for the software to be maintainable at least it must have: what it does, how it does it, how it is tested and how it is built
